# YALSI

Yet Another Least Squares Interface. Inspired by
[lsqfit](https://github.com/gplepage/lsqfit). Under development.

## Planned features

  * Bias correction for nonlinear least squares.
  
  * Approximate second order moment propagation.
  
  * Distributional estimation with maximum entropy.
